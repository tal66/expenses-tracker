## Start

See instructions in the [Install](#install) section, and then:

```bash
python main.py
```

To run DEMO expenses data:

```bash
python main.py demo
```



## Features

One-click to: 
- Download last quarter credit card expenses
- Visualize expenses by categories and months
- Get AI-powered insights

Less than 60 seconds to get a full picture of your expenses.

---

Automation:
- Download expenses data from credit card provider (currently only supports 'Max' credit cards)
- App is set to download last quarter files (can be changed in the code)
- Notes: 
  - You may get different popups than me, and have to alter the code or handle them manually.
  - It downloads the files in ~20 seconds for me. It could be faster and headless, but the current way: 
      - allows the user to see what's happening and whether the site changed since the last time 
      - allows the site to load at each step
      - ideally, the user+password permissions would be READ only, but they grant WRITE permissions. If it was READ only, I wouldn't care and just run it in the background fast, but that's not the case. 

UI:
- Expense category analysis with bar and pie charts
- Monthly totals visualization
- Detailed transactions table
- Monthly filtering

AI Insights:
- Summary
- Suggestions and insights


Possible TODO: add automation to download the pdf files as well, and not just the Excel files, and compare the sums to be sure that the Excel data is full and correct (the pdf is always final).  

## Install

Fill in credit card credentials in `config.toml`, and optionally add Gemini API key,  
and user background in `expenses_tracker/data/user_background.txt`.
Then:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

```bash
playwright install
```
