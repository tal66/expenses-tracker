See instructions in the [Install](#install) section, and then:

```bash
python main.py
```

To run DEMO expenses data:

```bash
python main.py demo
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you do not have software development knowledge OR if you are not aware of the benefits as well as dangers of using automations that are given permissions on your behalf - it is advised not to use this app. In any case, you must read the [Legal](#legal) section before using this software.
<br/>That said, there's a 99% (made up number) chance it's just fine, and I use it.

## Features

One-click to: 
- Download last quarter credit card expenses
- Visualize expenses by categories and months
- Get AI-powered insights

Less than 60 seconds to get a full picture of your expenses.

---

Automation:
- Download expenses data from credit card provider (currently only supports 'Max' credit cards)
- App is set to download last quarter files (can be changed in the code)
- Notes: 
  - You may get different popups than me, and have to alter the code or handle them manually.
  - It downloads the files in ~20 seconds for me. It could be faster and headless, but the current way: 
      - allows the user to see what's happening and whether the site changed since the last time 
      - allows the site to load at each step
      - ideally, the user+password permissions would be READ only, but they grant WRITE permissions. If it was READ only, I wouldn't care and just run it in the background fast, but that's not the case. 

UI:
- Expense category analysis with bar and pie charts
- Monthly totals visualization
- Detailed transactions table
- Monthly filtering

AI Insights:
- Summary
- Suggestions and insights


Done: ~~Possible TODO~~: add automation to download the pdf files as well, and compare sums to be sure that the Excel data is full and correct (the pdf is always final).

## Install

Fill in credit card credentials in `config.toml`, and optionally add Gemini API key,  
and user background in `expenses_tracker/data/user_background.txt`.
Then:

pip install -e .
```

playwright install
